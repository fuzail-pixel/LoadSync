## üìö API Endpoints

### Load Management
- `POST /load` - Create a new load
- `GET /load` - Fetch loads (supports filtering by shipperId, truckType, etc.)
- `GET /load/{loadId}` - Get specific load details
- `PUT /load/{loadId}` - Update load details
- `DELETE /load/{loadId}` - Delete a load

### Booking Management
- `POST /booking` - Create a new booking
- `GET /booking` - Fetch bookings (supports filtering by shipperId, transporterId)
- `GET /booking/{bookingId}` - Get specific booking details
- `PUT /booking/{bookingId}` - Update booking details
- `DELETE /booking/{bookingId}` - Delete a booking

## üîí Business Rules

### Load Rules
- Status defaults to `POSTED` when a load is created
- Status changes to `BOOKED` when a booking is made
- Status changes to `CANCELLED` when a booking is deleted

### Booking Rules
- Bookings cannot be created for loads with `CANCELLED` status
- Booking status changes to `ACCEPTED` when accepted by the shipper

### Create a Load
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/load \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "shipperId": "SHIP123",
    "facility": {
      "loadingPoint": "Mumbai",
      "unloadingPoint": "Delhi",
      "loadingDate": "2025-04-15T08:00:00",
      "unloadingDate": "2025-04-17T18:00:00"
    },
    "productType": "Electronics",
    "truckType": "Closed",
    "noOfTrucks": 2,
    "weight": 5000,
    "comment": "Handle with care"
  }'
```

### Create a Booking
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/booking \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "loadId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
    "transporterId": "TRANS456",
    "proposedRate": 25000,

  }'
```

## üß™ Testing

Run tests with Maven:
```bash
mvn test
```


## üõ°Ô∏è Assumptions

1. Authentication and authorization are implemented but not detailed in this README
2. Rate limiting and other API protection measures are in place
3. The system supports concurrency with proper locking mechanisms
4. Transactions are properly managed to ensure data integrity
5. The database schema is optimized for the specific queries required

## üìà Future Enhancements

- Implement notification service for status changes
